\f0\fs24 \cf0 LEVEL CREATION\
Each level is created by a text file following the convention of level# where # represents the level number starting from 1.  \
\
Levels can have up to 4 rows of bricks with each row having 8 bricks.  You can change the number of rows and columns, but make sure that the number of columns is greater than the number of rows and the result of the division of number of columns into the number of rows is a whole number.  \
\
You can change the levels as much as you like and create new ones.  Just make sure to change the max number of levels in the generator if you have more than 2 levels or decide to get rid of the 2nd level.\
\
B = Brick\
G = Golden Bar\
 = Empty Space\
\
PLAYER STARTING LIVES\
Player starting lives can be changed from anywhere from 1 - large positive number by clicking on the Player game object in the hierarchy and changing the starting lives property in the inspector.\
\
CONTROLS\
To move the paddle, use the standard horizontal axis controls: A, D or <\'97 \'97>\
To launch the ball, press [SPACE]\
To reset the level, press [ENTER]\
To go to next level once you cleared all of the bricks of the current level, press n\
\
POWERUP\
If you hit the golden bar with the ball, the ball\'92s size becomes double.  Hitting another golden bar while the bar\'92s size is already doubled, doesn\'92t do anything.  This is to keep the ball from reaching a ridiculous size that covers the screen.\
